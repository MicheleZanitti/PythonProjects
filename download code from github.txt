How to download this repository from github: https://github.com/MicheleZanitti/PythonProject

steps: if you don't have a folder for your project create it (0)
       open a terminal and move to the folder you have created (1-2)
       now 




0. create a folder called "Projects" in Documents (or anywhere you want to store your projects)


1. open a new terminal in jupyter: new>Terminal (a new tab will open)
    you will see a bunch of text and at the end, something like this: 
        
        PS C:\Users\miche>
        
        or, if you are in windows:
        
        miche@LAPTOP-CIS494CN:/mnt/c/Users/miche$
        
    You can see from these lines that your current directory is miche (and the path to reach it from the root folder is everything behind)    
    
    Regardless of the operative system, you can write some commands after these lines. 
    
    
    
2. navigate where the Project folder is from the terminal, basic commands used are:
    
    ls             (it will show all files and subfolders contained in the current folder)
    ls -l          (will show things with more details)
    cd folder_name (stands for change directory, you will enter the folder folder_name)
    cd ..          (go to the previous folder)
    
    
    in our case, if you have created the folder Projects in Documents, the commands are:
    check first that your current folder has a subfolder called Documents
    
        cd Documents
        cd Projects
        
        
3. Write the command to download a github repository: git clone <URL>
    
    git clone https://github.com/MicheleZanitti/PythonProject
    
    Hopefully everything works.
